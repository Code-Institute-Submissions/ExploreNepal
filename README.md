## Issues and Resolutions
- Issue with Navbar as Navbar did not overlay correctly on top of video on Home page which resulted Navbar appear seperately on top of the page and [video display only below Navbar](assets/bugs/issue-navbar.jpg).
  - I have fixed this issue by utilizing the devtool : bg-dark class that was added to nav replaced  by bg-light class then set background color of bg-light class to #24537005 which
ressolved an issue.
- [Background video on the home page did not cover entire screen](assets/bugs/padding-issue.jpg) eventhough container-fluid class was used, instead left with some white space on both left and right hand side of the screen which was not desired outcome.
  - Issue was fixed by adding some extra css property to main container class: value of 0 set to both padding right and padding left to main-container class and this solved issue.
- Padding issue between the columns inside the row : while using col-md-2 classes to created two columns inide the row there was a [excess white space between those columns](assets/bugs/issue-padding.jpg) however no space between colums was desired outcome.
  - I have used bootstrap documentation to find the solution of this : I added no-gutters class to the row which hold those columns and this solve an issue.  
- I noticed that [top section of second page was overlapping](assets/bugs/issue-margin.jpg) on the bottom of the first page which i didnt wanted and this was definitely a poorly presented pahe which needed to be fixed.
  - On my style.css I had previously used negative margin-top of 80px to the home id which was used for different purpose however this was causing an issue with page overlapping and issue resolved once i remove this style from my style.css 
- I was having an issue with Buttons not displaying correctly, there was 6 buttons used inside one of the column inside the expo id and those buttons were expected to display inline while viewing the page on small screen size however result was opposite as all the [buttons were shown vertically as a block element rather than inline display](assets/bugs/issue-margin2.jpg).
  - I added 50% of both margin right and left value to button class during inital styling process inorder to display button in the centre however this was the main reason causing an issue, once I remove both margin property from style.css, I got an [outcome](assets/bugs/issue-margin3.jpg) that I wanted.
- After I add some content and style to #expo add #contact, I noticed a bit strange issue on my page as [sections were overlapping](assets/bugs/issue-height.jpg) to each other while viewing on smaller and medium screen.
  - I initially gave height value of 100vh to all sections as i wanted the sections to cover the entire screen however this was causing the contents overlapping, I have fixed this issue by changing the vaulu of height for those ids to auto and this ressolved an issue.
- I had an issue with my carousel during build up process as one of carousel indicator was not functioning while clicking over the indicator.
  - After checking all of my codes, I found that there was [spelling error](assets/bugs/issue-carousel.jpg) on one of the carousel indicator class which was causing an issue, issue ressolved once I corrected spelling.
- Background Image that I added to contact section did not displayed while viewing page on browser, insted threw 404 error.
  - Issue happen due to [incorrect filepath](assets/bugs/issue-filepath) of image, Once i updated the filepath correctly it fixed an issue.
