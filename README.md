The website serves as an educational site for sharing information and knowledge about Nepal. The development of this website is targeted to educate the users or readers to 
get familiar with Nepal as country, its vast cultures, the interesting places as attractions to visit and most importantly to introduce some of Nepalese traditional cuisines.
Another purpose of this website is to interact with users or readers by allowing them to share their experiences about Nepal whether through travelling or any ideas to be 
included into this website. The website also displays various images of places in Nepal and Nepalese cuisines to help users and readers with the visualizations of the topics. 
Interactive Google map is added to allow users to locate the interesting and beautiful places in various regions of Nepal. 
With the specified purpose and aim in mind, I have decided to build this website to reach out to the broader and wider users around the world, while also trying to introduce 
the amazing yet interesting information about Nepal. This will hopefully attract more people or traveller to visit the beautiful Nepal once the pandemic is over as well as 
trigger the interests of all the users who access this website.

## Issues and Resolutions
- Issue with Navbar as Navbar did not overlay correctly on top of video on Home page which resulted Navbar appear seperately on top of the page and [video display only below Navbar](assets/images/navbar-issue1.jpg).
  - I have fixed this issue by utilizing the devtool : bg-dark class that was added to nav replaced  by bg-light class then set background color of bg-light class to #24537005 which
ressolved an issue.
